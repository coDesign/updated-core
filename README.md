Everything here rests on the [www.choraleapp.com](https://www.choraleapp.com) domain. The entire website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a static site generator in Go, then the SCSS and JS resources are piped through Gulp for optimizations. The end result is constructed and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/?ref=choraleappdotcomgithub).

## Browser support

Right now we support the latest versions of these browsers:

+ Chrome
+ Edge
+ Firefox
+ Safari

This is not to say that the Chorale site cannot be used in browsers older than those reflected, but merely that our focus will be on ensuring everything works great on just those.

## Development

To build the CSS & JS, enter `gulp`. To preview the site, enter `hugo serve`.
