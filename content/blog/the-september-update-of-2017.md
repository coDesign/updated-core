title: It’s September, 2017! What’s new?
description: Well, a lot, it seems. The seeming lack of updates or any activity on our Discord suggests something is going wrong, so let’s unravel this mystery.

First off, what’s going on? Well, I’m the only person working on this project right now and when I am busy, Chorale suffers because of it. However, I want Chorale to be at its best, so I finally did *something*! Here’s what’s new on the fore-front:

* Both, the mobile and desktop, apps are now on [the.choraleapp.com](https://the.choraleapp.com)
* These apps share resources between each other to minimize duplicating code
* Settings are now saved and synced across both the mobile and desktop versions (because of shared code)
* You will (soon) need an account to be able to access these apps, more on this in a bit
* Code will soon be accessible on GitHub at [choraleapp/chorale-web](https://github.com/chorale/chorale-web)

Of course, I’m not done yet because there’s a lot more to work on, considering that Chorale is being re-written from the ground up! This list is short, because I’m just announcing the biggest changes right now. Smaller ones will be on [Discord](https://discord.io/choraleapp) first, then I’ll compile them for viewing on the blog.

The apps are currently only available for staff viewing, but at least staff can view something.

And the accounts! You’ll need one, so [request early access](/early-access) if you haven’t. Ensure that you supply us with your right email so you could create your account once we reach out to you. We will be looking for a [back-end developer](/contribute) to complete this mission, so if you know one *or are one*, [give us a shout](/contact).

Last off, I’m particularly excited to roll out the new updates to this website, actually, because they make [www.choraleapp.com](https://www.choraleapp.com) look a lot more polished. Here are the updates for the site:

* Performance updates, added lazy loading
* New website colors (old ones were purple and blue)
* Completely new look for the blog (newsroom)
* Added comment section, i.e. Reddit integration
* Added new post about this update
* Redesigned navigation (visually and programmatically)
* The Creator Center is now less useless
* The Early Access page is now less awful
* Added “Login” button to navigation
* Added about/community page
* New homepage (3 suggestions below scroll)
* Different, more simple language used across site (like on pricing page)
* Updated product tour page with screenshots, more features
* Revised “Wireless worries” blog post
* Removed “Coming soon” links in footer
* Social links are now icons
* New, more compact, footer design
* More consistent use of shadows
* Changes to the back-end of the site (different CSS layout)
* Turned favicon monochrome
* Added Apple Music to [comparison table](/tour#comparison)
* Comparison table more compact, added revision date
* Bug fixes
* Making strides to make sure the linter shuts up

You can view the [development progress from this PR](https://github.com/choraleapp/chorale/pull/5).

So, use the newly introduced comment section to say what you think! Hopefully all this hard work doesn’t get wasted! That’d be a shame.
